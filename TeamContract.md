# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

We will use Discord (server) as our main form of communications outside of classes. Targeted messages should be responded within 3 days.

Teammates should be notified if one cannot attend a meeting or a lab, or if there is a tRAT during lecture.

All communication will remain respectful.

---

### Attendance & Participation

Each team member commits to reading assigned materials and completing individual readiness work before class.

Team members should commit to attending all meetings, lectures, and lab sessions.

All members should also fully participate in the team project.

---

## Decision Making

Decisions should be made by consensus.

Otherwise, a majority vote should be taken, however views from those with opposing opinions should still be somewhat considered upon moving forward.

---
## Conflict resolution

The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion, by considering each side of the conflict.

If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

---

## Accountability

Other team members should be contacted/consulted with when problems arise, further assistance should be seeked from TAs/instructors.

One's share of work should be completed in a timely manner, best if approximate time of completion could be given at assignment of work.

By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
